## [Tutorial] Learning programming with Python

In this tutorial I will cover the basics of the Python Programming Language for use on both PC and PSP system.  
This tutorial requires previous programming knowledge (at least the basics).  
I write these tutorials based on my personal knowledge, don't take this as the ultimate tutorial, but rather a quick walkthrough.
